The number of mines in a board is pre-determined. 
A Beginner board has 10 mines on an 8-by-8 board, an Intermediate board has 40 mines on a 16-by-16 board, and an Expert board has 99 mines on a 16-by-30 board.

When a square is successfully opened without containing a mine, it shows a number. 
The number indicates the number of mines that exist in the eight squares touching the square the number was in.
If the number would have been a 0, the number 0 is not shown, and all squares touching that square are opened as well.

The grid of mines for a board is pre-generated before the start of the game. 
The first square clicked never contains a mine. 
If it did contain a mine in the board pre-generation, the mine is moved to the upper-left hand corner of the board, and if that was a mine, the next square over to the right, and so on.
